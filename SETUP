# Door sensor and website both take config from `/etc/doorpi`, which
# consists of the database host, user, password, and database name
# separated by newlines.

# The current configuration uses a SQL database from Scripts that is
# owned by the locker sipb-door. To set up a new database, run the
# following command:
# """
# CREATE TABLE door_status (
#     timestamp BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
#     status BOOLEAN NOT NULL
# );
# """
# Note that the timestamp field stores nanoseconds from the Unix epoch,
# and that status=True means the door was closed at that moment in time.
