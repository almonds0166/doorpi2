Door sensor and website both take config from `/etc/doorpi`, which consists of the database host, user, password, and database name separated by newlines.

The current configuration uses a SQL database from Scripts that is owned by the locker sipb-door. To set up a new database, run the following command:
"""
CREATE TABLE door_status (
    timestamp BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    status BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);
"""
Note that the timestamp field stores nanoseconds from the Unix epoch, and that status=True means the door was closed at that moment in time.

The door sensor requires the following packages (possibly incomplete):
 * python3-gpiozero
 * python3-pymysql

The website requires the following packages (possibly incomplete):
 * uwsgi
 * python3-pymysql
 * python3-flask
 * uwsgi
 * uwsgi-plugin-python3
